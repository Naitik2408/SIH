# 🔧 Fix: "main" has not been registered Error

## ❌ Error Message
```
ERROR  Invariant Violation: "main" has not been registered. This can happen if:
* Metro (the local dev server) is run from the wrong folder. Check if Metro is running, stop it and restart it in the current project.
* A module failed to load due to an error and `AppRegistry.registerComponent` wasn't called., js engine: hermes
```

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Created Proper Entry Point
Created `index.js` in project root:
```javascript
import { registerRootComponent } from 'expo';
import App from './App';

// registerRootComponent calls AppRegistry.registerComponent('main', () => App);
// It also ensures that whether you load the app in Expo Go or in a native build,
// the environment is set up appropriately
registerRootComponent(App);
```

### 2. Updated package.json
Changed the main entry point:
```json
{
  "main": "index.js"
}
```

### 3. Cleared Metro Cache
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

## 🔍 What Caused the Issue

1. **Missing Entry Point**: The app didn't have a proper `index.js` file to register the main component
2. **Incorrect Main Field**: `package.json` was pointing to `expo/AppEntry.js` which didn't exist
3. **Metro Cache**: Old cached files were causing conflicts

## 🚀 Verification

The app should now start successfully with:
- ✅ Metro server running on port 8082
- ✅ QR code displayed for Expo Go
- ✅ Development build ready
- ✅ No registration errors

## 🛠️ Alternative Solutions

If the issue persists, try these alternatives:

### Option 1: Manual AppRegistry (index.native.js)
```javascript
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';
import App from './App';

AppRegistry.registerComponent('main', () => App);
```

### Option 2: Clear All Caches
```bash
# Clear Expo cache
npx expo start --clear

# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Clear React Native cache
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

### Option 3: Restart Everything
```bash
# Kill all Metro processes
pkill -f metro

# Restart Expo
npx expo start --clear
```

## 📋 Prevention Tips

1. **Always have an index.js**: Entry point should exist in project root
2. **Use registerRootComponent**: For Expo projects, this is the recommended approach
3. **Check package.json main field**: Should point to existing file
4. **Clear cache when switching**: When changing entry points, always clear Metro cache
