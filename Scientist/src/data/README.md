# Geospatial Data Improvements

## Overview
We have successfully created a comprehensive user dataset and enhanced the geospatial visualization in the following ways:

## 1. User Data Creation
- **File**: `usersData.json`
- **Content**: 100 realistic users with:
  - Personal demographics (age, gender, occupation, income)
  - Home and work locations in Delhi NCR
  - Daily travel patterns
  - Transport preferences
  - Common destinations with frequency data
  - Weekly activity patterns

## 2. Enhanced Visualizations

### Heatmap Layer Improvements
- **Color-coded by purpose**: Different colors for residential, commercial, shopping, entertainment, etc.
- **Size indicates activity level**: Larger circles show higher trip frequency
- **Rich popup information**: Shows area name, trip counts, peak hours, transport modes, and user demographics
- **Real user data**: Based on actual user locations and travel patterns

### Origin-Destination (OD) Flow Improvements
- **Transport mode visualization**: Different colors for metro (blue), bus (green), car (orange), auto (red), bike (purple), walk (gray)
- **Line thickness**: Represents trip frequency
- **Dash patterns**: Different purposes have different line styles
- **Comprehensive popups**: Show route details, duration, transport mode, purpose, user demographics, and income levels

### Hexagonal Binning Improvements
- **Intelligent aggregation**: Groups nearby points into hexagonal areas
- **Purpose-based coloring**: Shows dominant activity type in each area
- **Activity breakdown**: Detailed statistics on transport modes and purposes
- **Meaningful thresholds**: Only shows areas with significant activity (3+ points)

## 3. Data Integration Features

### Real-time Statistics
- **Active Trips**: Dynamic count based on time filter
- **Hot Zones**: Areas with high activity levels
- **Peak Hours**: Calculated from actual data
- **User Demographics**: Live summary of age groups, income distribution

### Analytics Panel
- **Popular Routes**: Top 5 most frequent home-to-work routes
- **Transport Preferences**: Distribution of preferred transport modes
- **Demographics Summary**: Age group breakdown (young/middle/senior)
- **Income Distribution**: Low/middle/high income user counts

## 4. Data Processing Functions

### `getAreaStatistics()`
- Analyzes selected map areas
- Provides trip counts, transport mode distribution, and purpose breakdown
- Shows time-based activity patterns

### `getDemographicInsights()`
- Processes complete user dataset
- Generates demographic summaries
- Identifies popular routes and transport preferences

## 5. Technical Improvements

### Data Structure
- Standardized location objects with lat/lng coordinates
- Consistent time formats (24-hour)
- Normalized transport mode names
- Categorized trip purposes

### Performance
- Efficient data aggregation
- Smart filtering by time ranges
- Optimized rendering for large datasets

### User Experience
- Interactive popups with rich information
- Color-coding for easy interpretation
- Dynamic statistics updates
- Responsive design elements

## Usage
