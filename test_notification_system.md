## Features Implemented

### ✅ Dynamic Notification Badge

- Count updates in real-time when notifications are marked as read
- Shows "9+" for counts greater than 9
- Badge only appears when there are unread notifications

### ✅ Journey Completion Notifications

- Shows points earned, badges unlocked, and journey details
- Notifications are added to the top of the list

### ✅ Notification Mark-as-Read Functionality
- Individual notifications can be marked as read by tapping them
- "Mark All as Read" button with confirmation dialog
- Real-time sync between CustomerHome badge and CustomerNotifications

### ✅ State Management
- Notifications are managed at the CustomerTabNavigator level
- Shared state between CustomerHome and CustomerNotifications
- Props are passed down to synchronize state updates

## Technical Implementation

### Interfaces
```typescript
interface Notification {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    message: string;
    time: string;
    isRead: boolean;
    type: 'journey' | 'reward' | 'system' | 'update';
    data?: {
        tripId?: string;
        pointsEarned?: number;
        badges?: string[];
        duration?: string;
        [key: string]: any;
    };
}
```

### State Flow
1. CustomerTabNavigator maintains central notification state
2. Passes notifications and update handler to CustomerHome
3. CustomerHome displays badge with unread count
4. CustomerHome creates new notifications on journey completion
5. CustomerNotifications receives notifications as props
6. When notifications are marked as read, state updates flow back up
7. Badge count updates automatically

## User Experience
- Badge provides immediate visual feedback of unread notifications
- Journey completion creates satisfying notification with details
- Mark-as-read functionality is intuitive with confirmation dialogs
- Real-time updates ensure consistent state across screens
